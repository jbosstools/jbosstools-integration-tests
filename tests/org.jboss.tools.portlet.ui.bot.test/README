Portal

    org.jboss.tools.portlet.ui.bot.test
    Prerequisities - EPP 5.2.2, EPP 4.3, JBoss Portlet Bridge e.g. 2.1
    Run portlets_prepare_workspace launcher and set up paths to both EPP's and Portlet Bridge
    Then run AllTestsSuite_singleConfig launcher for each EPP.
    Test of seam portlet hot deployment sometimes freezes on EPP 5 and manually it is Ok (will be fixed)
