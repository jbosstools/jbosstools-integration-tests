Prerequisities - JBossAS 7, EAP 6
Optional - local EAP 6 and WFK 2 maven repository

mkdir ~/jbds_test
cd ~/jbds_test_git
git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-tests.git
git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base
Run eclipse in new workspace (~/jbds_test_workspace)
Import project jbosstools-base/tree/master/tests/plugins/org.jboss.tools.tests
Import project jbosstools-integration-tests/tests/jbosstools-integration-tests/tests/org.jboss.tools.ui.bot.ext.test

Change paths to servers in ${project_loc}/resoures/server_properties to your JBossAS and EAP installations.
Optional - open ${project_loc}/resources/settings.xml and change paths in "jboss-eap-maven-repository" and "jboss-wfk-repository" profiles to your local maven repositories, uncomment these profiles in section "<activeProfiles>" and comment out online repositories.
Run "RunTest" launcher (should be added automatically during import. Make sure that central tests project is active (selected), because variable ${project_loc} is used in launcher.

Attention - Test execution takes a long time (can be more than 2 hours). Random freeze can occur.

Good practices 
	Execute tests separatelly for JBossAS and EAP (ServerType annotation in CreateProjectsWithServerTest.java)
	Because of random freezes or such things, re-executing tests with already passed tests commented out can be a good practice ;-)
