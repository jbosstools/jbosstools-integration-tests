### What's tested?
## Archetypes
All archetypes, appearing on main page of JBoss Central are imported, checked for warnings&errors and deployed on server.
## Examples
Tests searches for tad "EAP-6.4.GA" in JBoss Central and imports all those examples, checks them for errors and deploys them to server.

### Running tests via maven

`mvn clean install` should be enough to run the tests against WildFly 8. Maven downloads runtime automatically, sets correct maven repository in eclipse and run the tests.

### Running tests from eclipse

* Download required servers (currently Wildfly8, EAP 6)
* Edit server configuration files (resources/generated/server_properties/*)
* Import launcher (resources/Central RedDeer Test.launch)
* Run
